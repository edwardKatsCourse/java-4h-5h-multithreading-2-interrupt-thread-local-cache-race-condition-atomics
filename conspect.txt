Thread interruption usually needs to be called on application exit.


Thread interruption - is a recommendation for the thread to stop (neither stops, nor pauses)
Thread has flag - is interrupted

.inputerrupt() set this flag to true

If thread is "sleeping" or "joining" for someone, InterruptedException will be thrown,
but isInterrupted flag would not be set to TRUE -> manual thread interruption inside.
